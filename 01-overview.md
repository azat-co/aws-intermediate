# Process

* Lectures, demos and hands-on labs - you'll download them soon
* Lunch break 12-1pm and 2 smaller breaks before and after
* Fill out sign up sheets and the DI evaluation *before* you leave (put them in the envelope)
* Slides are often just talking points because reading from slides is boring so pay attention and take notes!
* Labs have detailed step by step walk-throughs

# Questions

* General questions - ask during the open frame, NOT during the lecture (write it down to remember later)
* Specific questions (why XYZ is not working on my computer!?) - ask during labs
